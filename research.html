                <h4 name="phil">Shifting the Perspectival Landscape: Methods for Encoding, Identifying, and Selecting Perspectives.</h4>
                <p>My dissertation explores the semantics and pragmatics of perspectival expressions. Perspective, or point-of-view, encompasses an individual’s thoughts, perceptions, and location. Many expressions in natural language have components of their meanings that shift depending on whose perspective they are evaluated against. I explore two sets of questions relating to perspective sensitivity. The first set of questions relate to how perspective is encoded in the semantics of perspectival expressions. The second set of questions relate to how conversation participants treat perspectival expressions: the speaker’s selection of a perspective and the listener’s identification of the speaker’s perspective.</p>
                <p>The main contributions are: (1) a comparison of four approaches to encoding the semantics of perspective, leading to a diagnostic toolkit for perspectival expressions; (2) an experimental case study that employs the diagnostics to identify a novel perspectival expression; (3) an implemented computational model of perspective identification, supported by experimental evidence; and (4) an implemented computational model of perspective selection, which reveals further challenges in perspective production.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">

            <h4 class="project">Temporal Reference in English</h4>
                <p>I am investigating shifted readings of temporal adverbials like "tomorrow" in English. Ordinarily, these expressions use utterance time as their reference point, but in shifted readings, they anchor instead to a salient reference time in the previous context. I'm running experiments using Lego comic strips to explore how speakers interpret these shifted readings.</p>
                <p>I presented this work at the CUNY 2018 Sentence Processing conference and at Sinn und Bedeutung 2018.</p>

            <h3>Computational Work</h3>
            <div class="col-md-8">
            <h4 class="project">Bayesian Modeling of Perspective</h4>
                <p>I work on using Bayesian inference to model pragmatics in conversation. In particular, I've developed a perspectival version of the Rational Speech Acts model to capture how conversation participants interpret perspectival items in different utterance contexts. This work was implemented in the WebPPL probabilistic programming language.</p>

            <h4 class="project">Speech Recognition</h4>
                <p>I was affiliated with the Speech and Language group at BBN Technologies for two years, where I worked on neural networks for speech recognition.</p>
                <p>In my Summer 2019 internship, I worked on adapting masked language modeling techniques for faster rescoring of acoustic model lattices.</p>
                <p>In my Summer 2018 internship, I worked on recurrent neural networks for multi-dialectal speech recognition and neural machine translation methods for numerical expressions.</p>

            	<h4 class="project">Phonological Modeling</h4>
            	<p>As an RA for Gaja Jarosz, I worked on computational learners for phonological hidden structure.</p><p>I worked on improving the efficiency of the implementation of the expectation- and error-driven learners described in Jarosz 2015. I also wrote a JavaFX GUI for the learners.</p>
                
                <h4 class="project">Programming Languages</h4>
                <p>I spent a summer as an intern for Dr. Nate Foster in the Computer Science department at Cornell University. I presented results at <a href="https://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#popl">POPL 2014</a>.</p>

                <h4 class="project">San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec</h4>
                <p>Earlier in grad school, I conducted fieldwork on San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec, an endangered Otomanguean language in Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
                <p>In Summer 2017, I researched andative and venitive constructions, which are similar to the 'come get some cookies' construction in English. I presented this work at the Workshop on Multi-Verb Constructions: Semantic, Syntactic and Typological Perspectives (MVC) 2018 and at the 2018 annual meeting of SSILA.</p>
                <p>In Summer 2016, with funding from the Selkirk Linguistics Outreach Fund, I investigated perspectival motion verbs like <i>come</i> and <i>go</i>. I presented some of this work at the Texas Linguistics Society in 2019.</p>

                <h4 class="project">Fulbright Canada</h4>
                <p>From 2014-2015 I was a Fulbright Canada fellow, researching the role of technology in First Nations language revitalization. I was hosted by Dr. Leslie Saxon at University of Victoria and Dr. Jessica Coon at McGill University.</p>
                <p>In collaboration with McGill, Concordia, and Listuguj Education Directorate, I produced a language-learning website for Mi'gmaq: <a href="http://learn.migmaq.org">learn.migmaq.org.</a> You can read more about the Migmaq Research Partnership on its <a href="http://migmaq.org">blog</a>.</p>
