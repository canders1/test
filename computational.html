            <h4 class="project">Temporal Reference in English</h4>
                <p>I am investigating shifted readings of temporal adverbials like "tomorrow" in English. Ordinarily, these expressions use utterance time as their reference point, but in shifted readings, they anchor instead to a salient reference time in the previous context. I'm running experiments using Lego comic strips to explore how speakers interpret these shifted readings.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to borrow the Ibex Farm controller I wrote to run my experiments, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/canders1/ibex_pictures">here</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="project">Bayesian Modeling of Perspective</h4>
                <p>I work on using Bayesian inference to model pragmatics in conversation. In particular, I've developed a perspectival version of the Rational Speech Acts model to capture how conversation participants interpret perspectival items in different utterance contexts. This work was implemented in the WebPPL probabilistic programming language.</p>

            <h4>Speech Recognition</h4>
                <p>In Summer 2018, I interned at BBN Technologies in the Speech and Language group. I worked on applying recurrent neural networks to multi-dialectal language modeling. I also worked on neural machine translation methods for numerical expressions.</p>

            	<h4 class="project">Phonological Modeling</h4>
            	<p>I was the TA for Gaja Jarosz's graduate-level Cognitive Modeling class in Fall 2017. I taught weekly sessions on Python, and grade labs on computational techniques for psycholinguistics, like parsing, clustering, and neural nets.</p>
            	<p>As an RA for Gaja Jarosz, I worked on computational learners for phonological hidden structure.</p><p>I worked on improving the efficiency of the implementation of the expectation- and error-driven learners described in Jarosz 2015.</p><p>I also wrote a JavaFX GUI for the learners.</p>
                
                <h4 class="project">Programming Languages</h4>
                <p>I spent a summer as an intern for Dr. Nate Foster in the Computer Science department at Cornell University.</p>
                <p>I presented results at <a href="https://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#popl">POPL 2014</a>.</p>

                <h4 class="project">San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec</h4>
                <p>I conduct fieldwork on San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec, an endangered Otomanguean language in Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
                <p>In Summer 2017, I researched andative and venitive constructions, which are similar to the 'come get some cookies' construction in English. This work was funded by an RAship with Seth Cable under NSF grant BCS-1322770.</p>
                <p>I'll be presenting this work at the Workshop on Multi-Verb Constructions: Semantic, Syntactic and Typological Perspectives (MVC) in Berlin this December.</p>
                <p>In Summer 2016, I investigated perspectival motion verbs like <i>come</i> and <i>go</i>. This work was funded by the Selkirk Linguistics Outreach Fund.</p>

                <h4 class="project">Fulbright Canada</h4>
                <p>From 2014-2015 I was a Fulbright Canada fellow, researching the role of technology in First Nations language revitalization.</p>
                <p>I was hosted by Dr. Leslie Saxon at University of Victoria and Dr. Jessica Coon at McGill University.</p>
                <p>In collaboration with McGill, Concordia, and Listuguj Education Directorate, I produced a language-learning website for Mi'gmaq: <a href="http://learn.migmaq.org">learn.migmaq.org.</a></p>
                <p>You can read more about the Migmaq Research Partnership on its <a href="http://migmaq.org">blog</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="project">Morphosyntax of Colonial Valley Zapotec</h4>
                <p>I've worked on topics in the morphosyntax of Colonial Valley Zapotec, most recently negation.</p>
                <p>Dr. Brook Lillehaugen and I presented a description of Colonial Valley Zapotec negation at <a href="http://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#colov">COLOV IV</a> and at the annual meeting of <a href="http://canders1.github.io/pubs/index.html#ssila">SSILA</a>.</p>
                <p>Our work is in press in the <i>Transactions of the Philological Society</i>.</p>
                
                <h4 class="project">The Ticha Project</h4>
                <p>In the summer of 2014, I helped develop a new online home for the <a href="http://ds.haverford.edu/ticha/">Ticha</a> project, a resource for Colonial Zapotec texts.</p>
                <p>Watch me talk about it:</p>
