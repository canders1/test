                <div>
                    <p>I am about to graduate with a PhD in Linguistics from UMass Amherst. In June 2020, I defended my dissertation, entitled <b>Shifting the Perspectival Landscape</b>.</p>
                    <p>In Fall 2021, I will be starting as an <b>assistant professor</b> in the <b>Wellesley College Computer Science</b> department.</p>
                    <p>I study <b>perspective</b> in language: the ways in which people's use of language depends on their point-of-view. This includes context-sensitive expressions that describe space and time as well as the ways in which people express their beliefs and opinions.</p>
                    <p>My work uses <b>experimental and computational methods</b> to understand how people express and track perspective across discourses and conversations. I use Bayesian inference techniques to model reasoning about perspective in conversation, and construct web-based experiments to gather empirical evidence.
                    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>I have also been affiliated with the Speech and Language group at BBN Technologies, where I worked on several topics in automatic speech recognition.</p>
                    <p>Much of my work has involved under-resourced languages. In particular, I have conducted fieldwork in Oaxaca, Mexico on San Lucas Quiavin√≠ Zapotec.</p>
