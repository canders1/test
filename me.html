            <h2>About</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In Fall 2021, I will be starting as an <b>assistant professor</b> in the <b>Wellesley College Computer Science</b> department.</p>

                <p>I recently received my PhD in Linguistics from UMass Amherst. My dissertation is entitled <b>Shifting the Perspectival Landscape</b> and was supervised by Rajesh Bhatt and Brian Dillon.</p>

                <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2014 with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science. I have also been affiliated with BBN Technologies, where I worked on automatic speech recognition.</p>

                <p><b>You can download my CV</b> <a href="https://canders1.github.io/pdf/anderson_cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="project">Research</h3>
            <div>
                <p>My current research focuses on <b>perspective</b> in language: the ways in which people's use of language depends on their point-of-view. This includes context-sensitive expressions that describe space and time (<i>tomorrow</i>, <i>here</i>) as well as the ways in which people express their beliefs and opinions (<i>tasty</i>, <i>that jerk!</i>).</p>

                <p>I use a variety of methodologies to look at how people and computers encode meaning in language. I use Bayesian inference techniques to model reasoning about perspective in conversation, conduct web-based experiments to understand human language use, and design probe tasks to assess the linguistic abilities of machine learning models.</p>

                <p>Earlier, I worked on semantic documentation of under-resourced languages, in particular, San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec.</p>

                <p>This is the section where I give fun facts about myself!</p>
                <p>For linguists, a fun fact is: my idiolect also includes "This is the section where I give fun facts about me!", but it is not obligatorily <i>de se</i>-interpreted.</p>
                <p>For computer scientists, a fun fact is: I took my first CS class because it was a lab class without any glassware to drop.</p>
                <p>For both computer scientists and linguists, a fun fact is: my favorite kind of lambda expression reduction is alpha conversion.</p>
                <p>There are no other fun facts about me.</p>
