Indigenous peoples must participate in educational decision making; they must be allowed to design and create the tools they need to transform the existing crises."</p>

        <p>"It is not only that those who know the ceremonies and the languages have a role to play in the revitalization and decolonization of our communities, but also that those of us who know of our ceremonies and languages can understand the need to regenerate our ways.... These underground speakers might require support and encouragement to bring their language back into the light so that we can work together to regenerate Kwak’wala in our communities. Both underground speakers and those exposed to Kwak’wala ‘from the shadows’ have knowledge and experiences important to the survival of our language, however fragmented or incomplete these may be. In the recovery of potlatch practices in the decades since the ban was lifted, those who participated in secret or watched from the shadows have used what they saw or learned to contribute to the revitalization of our ceremonial practices."</p>
